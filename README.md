# Trace-Analyzer-for-UnetStack
The Trace Analyzer tool is developed explicitly for trace analysis for the underwater network simulator UnetStack.  When you run a simulation in UnetStack, it generates two files as a result of the simulation: log/log-0.txt and trace.json. Manually analyzing these trace files to obtain simulation performance metrics is a time-consuming and lengthy process. The trace Analyzer tool takes the trace.json file as an input and then extracts useful data to calculate performance parameters by processing each and every event logged in the trace.json file.   After extracting the necessary data, the Trace Analyzer tool presents the network performance metrics such as throughput, average end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio in the form of graphs.
#  How to Install and Run the Tool
The UnetStack Trace Analyzer tool has been developed on the Ubuntu 20.04. The tool has been written in Python programming language and the Pythonâ€™s Tkinter package has been used to create the GUI. To use the tool, you must have Python installed on your system, as well as the Tkinter package from Python.
Download the code and open the folder in the terminal. In the folder, there are three files - start.py, trace.py, and check_sources.py. To start the tool run the start.py file. you will get the GUI window of the tool as shown in the below picture.

# How to Use the Tool

When you run the start.py, a window will be popup as shown in the above picture. UnetStack trace analyzer has two entries. The first entry is used to select the trace.json file of a simulation from the user's computer. The second entry is used to enter the no of sources available in the simulation topology. The trace analyzer tool is capable of checking whether the entered no of sources is correct or not. If it is found that the no of sources entered by the user is greater than the sources available in the simulation topology, it popup with an error message saying "enter the correct no of sources" or else it shows results. UnetStack trace analyzer has three buttons. The first button is used to give a command to the tool to show results. As a result, it will plot a graph for average end-to-end delay per simulation, throughput per simulation, and packet delivery ratio per simulation. The second button is to reset the entry of the tool. The third button is used to quit the tool. 
### Prerequisites for the Tool
1. Sources should be named as S1, S2, S3, ..........Sn.
2. Destination should be named "Sink".
3. Reliability should be set to false.
